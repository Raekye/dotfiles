## `systemd`
```bash
# Logs since the most recent boot (i.e. the current one).
journalctl --boot=0
journalctl --boot=-0
journalctl -b 0
journalctl -b

# Logs since the previous boot.
journalctl --boot=-1

# Logs since the first recorded boot.
journalctl --boot=1

# Show only kernel messages (implies `-b`).
journalctl --dmesg
journalctl -k

# Show most recent 10 entries.
journalctl --lines=10
journalctl -n 10
journalctl --lines # The default value is 10 if no argument is given.

# Show oldest 10 entries.
journalctl --lines=+10

# Show most recent entries, and continuously print new entries (implies `-n`).
journalctl --follow
journalctl -f

# Jump to pager end (implies `-n1000` to avoid unbounded buffering).
journalctl --pager-end
journalctl -e
```

### Basic Syntax
- Configuration entries are written as `key=value`; <q>whitespace immediately before or after the "`=`" is ignored</q>.
- <q>Empty lines and lines starting with "`#`" or "`;`" are ignored</q>.
	In particular, comments cannot be started mid-line.
- <q>Lines ending in a backslash are concatenated with the following line while reading and the backslash is replaced by a space character</q>.

Sources:
- `man systemd.syntax`: <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.syntax.html>.

#### Quoting
- Only applies to settings where quoting is allowed.
- Single and double quotes are equivalent.
- <q>The opening quote may appear only at the beginning or after whitespace that is not quoted, and the closing quote must be followed by whitespace or the end of line</q>.
- The enclosed text becomes part of the same item.
- <q>Quotes themselves are removed</q>.
- <q>C-style escapes are supported</q> (e.g. `\\n`); <q>unknown patterns will result in a warning</q>.

Sources:
- `man systemd.syntax` under "Quoting": <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.syntax.html#Quoting>.

#### Command Lines
- Applies to `ExecStart=` and similar.
- Does **not** implicitly invoke a shell; parsing is performed by systemd.
- Executable can be a simple file name (without slashes) if it resides in `systemd-path search-binaries-default`.
- <q>An argument solely consisting of "`;`" must be escaped, i.e. specified as "`\\;`"</q>.

Sources:
- `man systemd.service` under "Command Lines": <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html#Command%20lines>.

#### Parsing
1. [Specifiers][specifiers] (e.g. `%h`) <q>are replaced when the unit files are loaded.
2. <q>For settings where quoting is allowed</q>, quotes are processed and "unquoted" as in [quoting][#quoting].
3. Where applicable, environment variables are expanded; in the case of command lines, for each item (i.e. argument):
	- if the argument contains an identifier enclosed with curly braces, e.g. `${FOO}`,
		then the variable is expanded into the same token; i.e. <q>always resulting in exactly a single argument</q>;
	- if the argument solely consists of a dollar sign followed by an identifier, e.g. `$FOO`,
		then the variable is expanded **and further split on whitespace**, <q>resulting in zero or more arguments</q>.
		<q>For this type of expansion, quotes are respected when splitting into words, and afterwards removed</q>.

In particular:
- `$FOO` and `"$FOO"` are always equivalent, and do not ensure that the expansion of `$FOO` will be passed as a single argument.
- If a specifier expands to contain quotes or environment variables, those will be processed as if the user wrote the expansion.

See also:
- [`specifier_printf`][specifier-printf]: the function that performs the specifier replacement.
- [`replace_env_argv`][replace-env-argv]: the function that expands environment variables.

#### Examples
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Example: backslash escapes

[Service]
Type=oneshot
# By default, `echo` does not interpret backslash escapes; we will see "exactly what `echo` sees".
ExecStart=echo . [\\n] . [\n] .

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Outputs:

```
. [\n] . [
] .
```

---
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Example: environment variables

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Environment="FOO='one two' three"
ExecStart=echo == $$FOO
ExecStart=printf [%%s]\\n $FOO
ExecStart=echo == \"$$FOO\"
ExecStart=printf [%%s]\\n "$FOO"
ExecStart=echo == $${FOO}
ExecStart=printf [%%s]\\n ${FOO}

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Outputs:

```
== $FOO
[one two]
[three]
== "$FOO"
[one two]
[three]
== ${FOO}
['one two' three]
```

---
```bash
useradd --home-dir='/home/${USER}' someone
```

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Example: backslash escapes

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=echo ${HOME}
ExecStart=echo ${USER}
ExecStart=echo %h

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Outputs:

```
/home/${USER}
someone
/home/someone
```

### Other Quirks
- Unless a process specifically logs to journald (i.e. not simply the default behaviour of piping a service's standard streams to journald's logging helper),
	trailing whitespace is removed and empty lines are dropped (<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/sd_journal_print.html>).
- `SuccessExitStatus=` ([doc](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html#SuccessExitStatus=))
	does not affect the naming in `systemctl status` output (<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/15757>).
